Profile Pictures
- We improved our LurkforWork UI by adding user's profile pictures to everything they post, such as likes, comments and watchers. 
- This makes the website more personal and visually appealing to use, since users do not have to rely on reading a name, rather can see the person's profile picture. 
- Additionally, we added the logged-in user's profile picture on the feed screen, adding to the look of the website.

Confirmation Pop-ups
- Additionally, we added in features which help with the user experience. By adding in confirmation popups on log out and delete job, we prevent users from accidentally logging out of their account/deleting jobs. 
- Users may unintentionally click the logout button, and having a modal asking them to confirm their intention can prevent this from happening. 
- This helps improve the user experience and also prevents frustrating mistakes that take up time on the user's side.

Log Out Function
- We realised that there was no ability to log out. Once you have logged in, you are virtually stuck in the one profile (except for refreshing the page, which technically isn't right). 
- This function was added in pretty easily, next to profile on the nav bar.

Hover Tooltips for icons 
- We supplemented the individual icons on the page navigation bar, and on the user profile page (edit and delete icons) with a tooltip on hover.
- This allows users to better understand the page navigation, and thus improves the usability and feedback.
